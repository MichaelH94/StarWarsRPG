# StarWarsRPG
Homework for KU Coding Bootcamp

This is a simple RPG game involving Star Wars characters. It was coded in JavaScript using JQuery, and is displayed through HTML & CSS with Bootstrap. Players select a character and an opponent, and then click the attack button to progress. The characters all have a set health, attack, and defence level that is used to calculate the fight. The success of the game relies on which path each character takes and can be completed by all 4 characters.

For grading purposes, the paths can be found in the console.
